        var texts = ["Chip Bok’s political comic plays off of Bernie Sander’s argument in a debate that climate change is directly related to the growth of terrorism, e.g. that climate change will cause water shortages, drought, and mass migration, creating a disgruntled, unstable populace that will be easily swayed by radical groups. Bok criticizes the over-generalization of Sander’s argument and mocks his claim by using personification of nature and the popular image of polar bears losing their habitat due to climate change. Nature is thus used as a humorous counterpoint in a political argument.",
                     "This comic deals with the topic of energy and the common counter arguments to each strategy. Joe Heller juxtaposes the dangerous and life-threatening accidents from nuclear, oil, and coal with the mere nuisance of wind energy. Interestingly, nuclear energy is portrayed in the same light as oil and coal despite its usual categorization under renewable energy. The main criticism of the comic comes down to the people who desire their local environment to be free from visual annoyances like a wind turbine. Heller seems to be supporting wind energy as an alternative to other riskier technologies.",
                     "This animated short depicts man as a careless, violent destroyer. There is seemingly no stopping humanity as it ravages the environment for natural resources and kills animals for food, clothes, or pleasure. The short is perhaps overly dramatic, but its purpose is to bring awareness to the many consumers of the world the pollution and suffering that industry creates. Animals in particular are highlighted as victims of humanity through hunting and food processing. There is no apparent solution to the devastation of man besides the death of humanity through over-pollution and nothing short of an alien invasion. Politically, large industries seem to be the enemy in this video.",
                     "Erin Brockovich is a dramatized, biographical film centering around the lawsuit of Anderson, et al. v. Pacific Gas and Electric for using chromium-6 for compressor cooling and storing the contaminated water in unlined ponds allowing it to spread into the groundwater. The chromium-6 was linked to a cluster of cancer cases in Hinkley and resulted in the largest direct-action lawsuit settlement in US history. The movie deals with the politics surrounding the cover up of the pollution and the working of large corporations which seem to be above the law.",
                     "The Machine in the Garden focuses on the titular literary trope of industrialization interrupting pastoral beauty. This idea entered the literary psyche in the nineteenth century and showed a landmark shift of the American mindset towards power and wealth over a simpler agrarian lifestyle. This particular passage notes the staying power of the pastoral dream in America, shown in political representation and popular culture. Today however, industry reigns as the main force in politics as shown by corporations obtaining personhood and avoiding taxes through loopholes. In this regard, it seems that politics correlates with the strength of each side on the agrarian vs industrial conflict.",
                     "The Grapes of Wrath deals with the economic hardships that are tied closely to the environment’s wellbeing, i.e. the Dust Bowl. The novel focuses on the oppressed people of America, showing their plights to the masses. Government programs like the New Deal offer camps for these economic refugees, but the exploitation of the workers seems unstoppable. Facing ecological disaster and no hope for the future, the poor turn to fighting their oppressors through strikes and unionization. There is almost no way for a single poor family to have their voices heard, but together they may hope to make a difference.",
                     "Species in Pieces is an interactive, digital exhibition focused on endangered species. Each animal is created from CSS polygons, emphasizing the fragility of each species. Though the project is not directly affiliated with any organization, there are many conservation societies linked in the project that work to save these species through activism. For most of these endangered animals, the threat is humanity, whether it be through poaching, fishing, or environmental degradation. The implicit call to action to save these animals is a large scale, political movement that would have to decrease manufacturing, climate change, and hunting.",
                     "Spore 1.1 is a ubicomp device that connects the wellbeing of a plant with the health of a corporate entity – The Home Depot. The message is that economic activity affects more than just stock prices, but also the lives of employees, their families, and their surroundings, eventually reaching the natural environment. Home Depot in particular is an interesting choice since they are the supplier of the plant and many of their products are related to the environment. Spore 1.1 brings the responsibility of nature back into the business’s hands.",
                     "These photographs played a key role in the Cuban missile crisis prompting JFK’s ordering of a naval blockade on Cuba. As unannotated photos, these aerial shots could be simple nature photographs of a forest with some strange formations. In fact, it is likely the facility was built for obscurity within this dense forest. However, through experts’ interpretations these simple images become powerful political messages creating nationwide tension and fears of nuclear war. These photos show the truth behind “seeing is believing” as a motivator for action. Aerial photography has become commonplace in modern times but it still carries the messages of its creators.",
                     "U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell used these annotated photos as evidence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, leading to the Iraq War. Their political impact is obviously enormous, causing over 100,000 deaths in Iraq and contributing to instability within the Middle East. The deceit of these photos lies in the fact that no weapons of mass destruction were ever found. Despite hours of expert analysis and telescopic focus on groups of pixels, the photos were ultimately just the result of a bias in administration. As a result, satellite imagery is turned into a deadly war.",
