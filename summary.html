            <p style="color:rgb(255,255,255);font-size:22px;">The guiding motivation behind this project came from Carl<br>DiSalvo’s ideas of adversarial design and articulation which he uses to critique<br>ubicomp devices. DiSalvo describes adversarial design as “designs [that] do the<br>work of agonism,”
                that is, provokes political conflict for the purpose of<br>creating productive debate. His concept of devices of articulation has to do<br>with the connections ubicomp devices create that “extends outward to enroll<br>people, other entities
                in the environment, and even the environment itself.” <br><br>This exhibit is itself a digital media artifact and in<br>focusing on nature as a political force, it connects media artifacts together<br>in order to highlight certain aspects
                of their messages. I chose two artifacts<br>from each of the Pinterest collections that I could find political meaning within,<br>in order to achieve a balance of representation across media forms. The overall<br>message should be that
                politics pervades most media and that not all<br>connections are immediately obvious. After experiencing the exhibit, the effect<br>should be an appreciation for media creators and a greater understanding of how<br>media can vary but share
                certain themes.<br><br>Douglas Kellner’s ideas of critical media analysis also play<br>a role in this digital exhibit. Kellner promotes a threefold approach of production<br>and political economy, textual analysis, and audience reception
                in order to<br>truly consume media and understand it well. The exhibit should promote critical<br>thinking by helping the audience find connections it may have missed and<br>therefore providing a platform for readers to begin thinking
                of their own<br>connections. Media becomes a very political subject under Kellner’s analysis as<br>a way that content creators and larger organizations can inject their thoughts<br>into the minds of any unsuspecting consumers. The goal
                of this project is not quite<br>as dramatic as Kellner’s ideas on cultural analysis, but the idea of greater<br>media literacy is important in creating a modern populace that is ready to enter<br>the endless media of the internet. By taking
                a detailed look at different forms<br>of media, the exhibit pushes the audience to form its own opinions and perhaps<br>carry this attitude to the greater world of media beyond this site.<br><br>Another important idea that motivated this
                project was Lev<br>Manovich’s theory of the database as media. Manovich distinguishes a database<br>as “a list of items which it refuses to order” versus a narrative which<br>“creates a cause-and-effect trajectory of seemingly unordered
                items.” This<br>digital collection of artifacts lies somewhere in between a database and a<br>narrative since it establishes some organization of artifacts within the circle<br>and provides some cause-and-effect relationships between artifacts.
                As a<br>database, the individual artifacts of the collection can be experienced in any<br>order and no knowledge will be lost as a result. Using the affordances of the<br>digital media, the exhibit is more like an interactive narrative,
                or<br>“hyper-narrative” as Manovich calls it, in reference to hypertext links.<br></p>
